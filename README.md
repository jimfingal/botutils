botutils
========

Collection of tools, scripts, and examples I find myself using a lot when I make bots.

Warning, this is way alpha, needs tests, not even sure if all the requirements are in here yet. Just started pulling things out and putting them in here, no idea if it works yet as a package.

Theoretically, can install via:

    pip install git+https://github.com/jimmytheleaf/botutils.git
