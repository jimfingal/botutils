botutils
========

Collection of tools, scripts, and examples I find myself using a lot when I make bots.

This is way alpha. Just started pulling things out and putting them in here, no idea if it works yet as a package.

Theoretically, can install via:

    pip install git+https://github.com/jimmytheleaf/botutils.git
